# # EPickerForREPIC

## Credits

EPicker is not developed by me! EPicker was developed by Xueming Li Lab. Click [here](https://github.com/thuem/EPicker) to visit their repository on Github and [here](http://thuem.net/software/epicker/overview.html) to visit the EPicker website.

## About

This repository was made because the [original EPicker repository](https://github.com/thuem/EPicker) is not updated to the most recent versions of EPicker found on the [EPicker website](http://thuem.net/software/epicker/overview.html). However, the installation scripts found on the website are hard and/or inconvenient to use.

Furthermore, this repository makes slight modifications to EPicker to allow for splitting data into training, testing, and validation folders, as well as running EPicker in a Conda environment (not a virtual one, which is the default).
